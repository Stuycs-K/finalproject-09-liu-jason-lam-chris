### 2024-05-15 - Researching Audio Steganography
Did research on different methods of steganography,
- Least Significant Bit
- Phase Coding
- Echo Hiding
- Spread Spectrum
- Frequency Masking
- Spectrogram Image Imbedding

Chris has to do something today so wasn't able to discuss what we will do for project in class but likely,,
- Least Significant Bit
- Spectrogram Image Imbedding
- and one other method

Did some research on how to make an image into a spectrogram.

Made a function to take in an image, grayscale it, and then normalize the values into an array. However to make it a spectrogram I think I have to use python.

### 2024-05-16 - Worked on Spectrogram Image Imbedding

Started preliminary code in turning an image into a wav file with message hidden in spectrogram.

### 2024-05-17 - Deepened understanding of Spectrogram Image Imbedding, Started making program more usable.

Did more research into what functions do as well as code behaviors.

### 2024-05-19 - Made Spectrogram Image have arguements. Finished preliminary program to hide in audio file.

Added commands for different factors of image in the spectrogram. 
Finished coding a method to add image to an existing spectrogram.
Need to add command line args.
